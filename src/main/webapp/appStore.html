        <p>Code Streamers allows programmers to stream code that they're currently working
        on so other users can watch the action.</p>
        <p>Progammers can log in using their Facebook account and set up a live stream.
        They can then send out the link to their friends, who can watch in real time as
        the programmer types his code.</p>
